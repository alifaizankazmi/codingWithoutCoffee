      <description>One of the first rules I learned when studying kdb+ was that the Q/kdb+ interpreter evaluates expressions from right to left, even though expressions are typed left-to-right. For instance, the result of the following expression:
2*3+3  is 12, since the addition operator and its operands are evaluated first and the result of the addition in turn becomes the second operand for the * operator.
Sound simple enough? I certainly thought so, until my forehead landed on my palm a few minutes later.</description>
